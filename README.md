# Notepad

This is a simple note-taking application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create, save, delete, and restore notes.

## Usage
### Creating a new note
To create a new note, enter a title and note content in the input fields and click the "Add Note" button.  
If either the title or note content fields are left empty, an error message will be displayed.

### Viewing notes
By default, the app displays all the created notes.  
Each note is displayed with its title and content, along with a "Delete" button to remove the note.

### Deleting a note
To delete a note, click the "Delete" button next to the note you want to remove.  
The deleted note will be moved to the "Trash" section of the app.

### Restoring a deleted note
To restore a deleted note, click the "Restore" button next to the note you want to restore.  
The note will be moved back to the main section of the app.

### Viewing deleted notes
To view deleted notes, click the "Trash" button in the header of the app.  
The deleted notes will be displayed in the "Trash" section with their titles and content, along with a "Delete" button to permanently remove them.

### Local Storage
The app uses local storage to save the notes and deleted notes data, so the data will persist even if the page is refreshed or closed.
